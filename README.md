My dotfiles

## Install
This install is if you have a new machine, and need everything setup.
For that, I sugguest

```
curl https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/xahgmah/dotfiles@master/install.sh | sh
```
If you already have things like git, homebrew,node etc installed, 
Run this commans:
```
git clone https://github.com/xahgmah/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles/
sh bootsrap.sh
```
